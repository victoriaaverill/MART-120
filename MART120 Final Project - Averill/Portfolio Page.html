        <h3>Week 1</h3>
        <h4>For week 1, I did my introduction video for MART120. I introduced myself as well as discussed my relationship with coding.</h4>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week2.png" height=200 width=300>
        <h3>Week 2</h3>
        <h4>For week 2, using AppLab on Code.org, I put together a drawing of my own to create a pattern with a geometric design. This helped me with understanding basic computer
            concepts and logical reasoning.</h4>
       <img src="./MART120 Folder/week3.png" height=200 width=300>
        <h3>Week 3</h3>
        <h4>For week 3, using Scratch, I created an interactive game. The arrow keys were programmed to move the dinosaur to the right of the screen,
            and then every time the mouse clicks on a balloon, the color of the balloon changes and the background is generated at random as well. </h4>

        <h3>Week 4</h3>
        <h4>Week 4 using Code.org again, I created another game that counted points as well as repeated movement between the figures.
            The spaceman had to collide with the robot to get points and the alien was an obstacle that would make the screen go black 
            as "you lost." Every time the spaceman collides with the robot, the points would go up. The robot was programmed to run away from the 
            spaceman at random, making it a challenge.
        </h4>

        <h3>Week 5</h3>
        <h4>In week five, I used Alice to create a small, briefly interactive scene. I places props and characters and then had speech bubbles
            and actions all timed to be qued based on the user's actions. The alien was the player's character and the other two figures reacted based
             on the player's actions.</h4>

        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week6pg3.png" height=300 width=500>
        <h3>Week 6</h3>
        <h4>For week 6, working with HTML, I created 3 web pages that go back and forth to each other with "next/previous Page" buttons.
            The first page consists of 3 lists: hobbies, restaurants, and websites. Page 2 consists of a story with an image. Page 3 Is a 
        contact information page. </h4>

        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week7pg2.png" height=300 width=500>
        <h3>Week 7</h3>
        <h4>Working with CSS, I took my work from Week 6 and added color, backgrounds, and other cosmetic details
            to my webpages.</h4>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week7pg3.png" height=400 width=500>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week8.png" height=200 width=300>
        <h3>Week 8</h3>
        <h4>For week 8, I incorporated JavaScript into my webpage with contact info by developing required fields. When a peice of the info was missing,
            after clicking submit, the page would highlight the missing fields in red. As a bonus, I participated in developing a math game which printed out percents and scores
            after answering 10 questions.
        </h4>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week9.png" height=400 width=250>
        <h3>Week 9</h3>
        <h4>Week 9 introduced p5.js which was used to develop a self portrait using geometric shapes.</h4>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week10.png" height=400 width=250>
        <h3>Week 10</h3>
        <h4>Mathh objects and basic operators were incorporated in the Week 9 project and used to make shapes of the self portrait move around the canvas.</h4>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week11.png" height=400 width=250>
        <h3>Week 11</h3>
        <h4>A canvas was created with a player and two obstacles of different sizes and colors. They moved randomly on the screen as the player
            is controlled with the "W" "A" "S" "D" keys. A third, non-moving obstacle appears where the mouse is clicked. Collisions were ignored and by using logical
            operators, "you win" is displayed once the player reached the exit on the bottom right of the canvas.
        </h4>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week12.png" height=400 width=250>
        <h3>Week 12</h3>
        <h4>Using week 11's project, Functions are used entirely.</h4>
        <img src="./MART120 Folder/week13.png" height=400 width=250>
        <h3>Week 13
        </h3>
        <h4>Week 13's project is the same project from week 11, however Arrays are used to create random shapes and 
            random directions and movements for the shapes throughout.
        </h4>
