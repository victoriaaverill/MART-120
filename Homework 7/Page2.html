<div id=ShortStory>
<p> Earlier this summer, I had a childhood friend reach out to me after seeing my photography on social media. 
    He asked me if I could help him create an album cover design for an album he had been working on.
    I gladly agreed to take on the project! His vision was a photo of him sitting on the bank of the Blackfoot River.
    We drove up to Lincoln, Montana and took forever to find the river. We eventually found a place, but there were many people there. 
    We went for it anyways, and I made the poor guy trudge through the river in his clothes to get to the other side of the bank.
    He lost his shoes, forgot his props, and overall it was a bit of a disaster. I did not get off easy either. I ended up waist-deep in the water with my camera.
    After many photos, we took off knowing we had a few good shots and started back to Helena, or so we thought. 
    After about an hour, I realized the land got very flat very fast as we headed toward the plains. 
    I asked him if we were supposed to turn at some point, and we both just burst out laughing. How could we have missed it?! 
    After awhile, we ended up in Craig, Montana and knew where we were, so we got on the highway towards Helena. It
    was a long detour, but we had a blast. Then, we sat down at a table and I worked my magic, and this is what we had come up with for 
    his ablum cover:
